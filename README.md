# Efficient-Entropy
This project computes entropy and joint entropy of images more efficiently than the standard formulae.
The main codes which implement the proposed formulae are `Entropy_Computation_Proposed.m` and `Joint_Entropy_Computation_Proposed.m`. The other two codes `Entropy_Computation_Standard.m`
and `Joint_Entropy_Computation_Standard.m` compute entropy and joint entropy respectively, using the standard formulae. All these codes can be run independently. They use the dataset
