# Efficient-Entropy
This project computes entropy and joint entropy of images more efficiently than the standard formulae.
The proposed entropy and joint entropy formulae are implemented in `Entropy_Computation_Proposed.m` and `Joint_Entropy_Computation_Proposed.m` respectively.
The standard entropy and joint entropy formulae are implemented in `Entropy_Computation_Standard.m` and `Joint_Entropy_Computation_Standard.m` respectively.
`Database` should be in the same directory from which the codes are run.
