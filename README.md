# Efficient-Entropy
This project computes entropy and joint entropy of images using a computationally efficient algorithm.
The proposed entropy and joint entropy formulae are implemented in `Entropy_Computation_Proposed.m` and `Joint_Entropy_Computation_Proposed.m` respectively.
The standard entropy and joint entropy formulae are implemented in `Entropy_Computation_Standard.m` and `Joint_Entropy_Computation_Standard.m` respectively. These are included for comparison.
`Database` should be in the same directory from which the codes are run. In order to run the proposed and standard algorithms conveniently, it is recommended that a
small subset of `Database` is used. `Database` contains 9979 images. It is included in the repository in order to enable reproduction of the results reported in the paper `An Efficient Method for Computation of Entropy and Joint Entropy of Images. In Intelligent Computing Theories and Application: 16th International Conference, ICIC 2020, Bari, Italy, October 2â€“5, 2020, Proceedings, Part I 16 (pp. 282-290).
